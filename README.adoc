= Caliber

This gem provides global link:https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop[RuboCop] configurations for ensuring
high quality _and consistent_ software development practices.

_Due to the ever changing nature of the RuboCop ecosystem -- and the fact you can fall behind quickly -- this gem takes an aggressive approach to staying atop the latest changes. This also means this gem might never reach Version 1.0.0 because new -- often breaking -- changes are being introduced in each minor release. That said, if you always want to keep pace with recent changes -- *because you know how costly technical debt is* -- then this gem has you covered. ðŸŽ‰_

== Features

* Provides a global configuration for the following code quality gems:
** {rubocop_link}
** {rubocop_capybara_link}
** {rubocop_factory_bot_link}
** {rubocop_performance_link}
** {rubocop_thread_safety_link}

== Requirements

* link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]
* link:https://github.com/ruby/rake[Rake]
* link:https://rspec.info[RSpec]

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# ðŸ’¡ Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/gems.pem)
gem install caliber --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install caliber
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add caliber
----

== Usage

This gem is designed to replace all of your RuboCop setup with only a single reference to this gem.
You'll want to start with your `Gemfile` by adding the following:

[source,ruby]
----
group :code_quality do
  gem "caliber"
end
----

Then, in your `.rubocop.yml`, add the following to the top of the file:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber: config/all.yml
----

That's it!

=== Customization

You can customize the gem by specifying what you need:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/ruby.yml
    - config/capybara.yml
    - config/factory_bot.yml
    - config/performance.yml
    - config/thread.yml
    - config/rake.yml
    - config/rspec.yml
----

The above is what `config/all.yml` expands to but now you can mix and match how you like for your specific needs.

=== Requirements

When Caliber is added to your `Gemfile`, you don't have to require RuboCop because Caliber does that for you by default. All RuboCop dependencies are also automatically required because they are defined in each configuration. Here's a full breakdown of how this works:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/all.yml
----

The above will require and load the configurations for following gems:

* {rubocop_link}
* {rubocop_capybara_link}
* {rubocop_factory_bot_link}
* {rubocop_performance_link}
* {rubocop_thread_safety_link}
* {rubocop_rake_link}
* {rubocop_rspec_link}

When you don't use the default `all.yml` configuration, then behavior changes as follows:

*Ruby*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/ruby.yml
----

The above will only load the {rubocop_link} Ruby configuration. No further requirements are necessary since Caliber already requires the RuboCop gem by default.

*Capybara*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/capybara.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_capybara_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

ðŸ’¡ This is a dependency of {rubocop_rspec_link} so doesn't need to be directly required if already requiring {rubocop_rspec_link}.

*FactoryBot*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/factory_bot.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_factory_bot_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

ðŸ’¡ This is a dependency of {rubocop_rspec_link} so doesn't need to be directly required if already requiring {rubocop_rspec_link}.

*Performance*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/peformance.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_performance_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

*Thread Safety*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/thread.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_thread_safety_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

*Rake*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/rake.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_rake_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

*RSpec*

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber:
    - config/rspec.yml
----

The above will only require the {rubocop_rspec_link} gem _and_ load the associated configuration.

=== Inheritance

Should you not want to include this gem in your project for some reason, you can directly inherit the configuration files supported by this project instead. To do this, you'll need to add the following to the top of your `.rubocop.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_from:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/all.yml
----

You'll also want to add `.rubocop-https*` to your project's `.gitignore` since imported RuboCop YAML configurations will be cached locally and you'll not want them checked into your source code repository.

If importing all configurations from `all.yml` is too much -- and much like you can do with requiring this gem directly -- you can mix and match what you want to import by defining which configurations you want to use. For example, the following is what `all.yml` expands too:

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_from:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/ruby.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/capybara.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/factory_bot.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/performance.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/thread.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/rake.yml
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/caliber/main/config/rspec.yml
----

You can also target a specific version of this gem by swapping out the `main` path in the YAML URLs listed above with a specific version like `0.0.0`.

Lastly, when using this YAML import approach, you'll not benefit from having all gems you need required and installed for you. So you'll need to manually require these gems in your `Gemfile`:

* {rubocop_link}
* {rubocop_capybara_link}
* {rubocop_factory_bot_link}
* {rubocop_performance_link}
* {rubocop_thread_safety_link}
* {rubocop_rake_link}
* {rubocop_rspec_link}

=== Coexistence

In situations where you'd like to use Caliber alongside additional RuboCop gems, you only need to add the new gems to your `Gemfile` and then require them within your `.rubocop.yml`. For example, let's say you wanted to use both the Caliber and link:https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-md[RuboCop Markdown] gems together. Here is how you can use both by updating your `.rubocop.yml` (assuming your `Gemfile` was updated as well):

[source,yaml]
----
inherit_gem:
  caliber: config/all.yml

require:
  - rubocop-md
----

Adding additional RuboCop gems only requires adding them to your YAML configuration.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/caliber
cd caliber
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

=== Check

Use the `bin/check` script -- when upgrading to newer RuboCop gem dependencies -- to check if
duplicate configurations exist. This ensures Caliber configurations don't duplicate effort provided
by RuboCop. The script _only identifies duplicate Caliber configurations which are enabled and have
no other settings_.

When both RuboCop and Caliber are in sync, the following will be output:

....
RUBY: âœ“
CAPYBARA: âœ“
FACTORY_BOT: âœ“
PERFORMANCE: âœ“
THREAD: âœ“
RAKE: âœ“
RSPEC: âœ“
....

When RuboCop has finally enabled cops that Caliber already has enabled, the following will display
as an example:

....
RUBY:
* Lint/BinaryOperatorWithIdenticalOperands
* Lint/ConstantDefinitionInBlock
CAPYBARA: âœ“
FACTORY_BOT: âœ“
PERFORMANCE: âœ“
THREAD: âœ“
RAKE: âœ“
RSPEC:
* RSpec/StubbedMock
....

The above can then be used as a checklist to remove from Caliber.
